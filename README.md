# Personal Blog Engine

This was my first PHP and MySQL project. I wanted to learn how the most simplistic blogs are built, so I spent a couple months putting this together. 

For this project:
- I developed a blog engine from scratch. This included the functionality to add, delete, and edits posts, add, delete, and edit comments, and a somewhat secure admin login.
- I learned how to incorporate MySQL into a project and how to avoid SQL injection.
- I built an RSS feed updater, to keep the rss.xml file updated without having to do it manually.
- I learned how to incorporate social media into a personal project.

This blog engine acted as my personal blog for some time, but I decided to move to <a href="www.dotordogh.wordpress.com">wordpress</a>.
